# Inventures Technical Test
The jupyter  notebook "inventures_test.ipynb" includes all the code used for this test, and it also includes the ouputs of each code block, but the street map plots can't be previewed on Github.

If you want to run it inside your own machine to view the street map plots, you have to install the required libraries with the command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
